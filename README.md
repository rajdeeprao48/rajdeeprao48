- 👋 Hi, I’m @rajdeeprao48, your friendly neighborhood coder!
- 👀 I’m interested in turning coffee into code, automating the boring stuff, and diving deep into data like a detective on a mystery case.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyze data like Sherlock Holmes—finding insights hidden in the noise, and using Python and Tableau to crack the case.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve AI, data science, and maybe even coding robots to do my laundry.
- 📫 How to reach me Drop me a line at rajdeeprao@amityonline.com—unless you're a bot, in which case, beep boop elsewhere!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but will also respond to "Hey, you!")
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to debug a sandwich... Turns out, it just needed more cheese.
